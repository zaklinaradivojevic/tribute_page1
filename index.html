        <p class="subhead">Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American scientist, physicist and electrical engineer. He was one of the brightest minds of mankind. He is said to be the man "who invented the twentieth century" and "Prometheus of the twentieth century."</p><br>
        <p>He is the first Serb to be nominated for the Nobel Prize and after whom the international unit of measure is named. He is the author of over 700 patents, and his most important inventions are: polyphasic system, rotating magnetic field, asynchronous motor, synchronous motor, Tesla transformer, alternating current system, etc.</p><br>
        <h1>Biography of Nikola Tesla</h1><br>
        <p class="subhead">He was born on July 10, 1856 in Smiljan, in the former Military Border of the Austrian Empire. Tesla's father's name was Milutin and he was an Orthodox priest. He loved to read and had a rich library where the scientist spent his childhood and learned foreign languages. During his life he spoke: Serbian, English, German, Italian, French, Czech, Hungarian, Latin and Slovenian. His mother's name was Đuka and she was a hard-working woman from whom Nikola inherited a penchant for research life. The mother, unlike the father, experienced all the glory of her son. He had one brother, Dane, and three sisters: Angelina, Milka and Marica. He was named after his paternal grandfather. He was baptized in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Peter and Paul in Smiljan.</p><br>

  <p>Milutin Tesla
</div>  
        <p>He finished the first grade in his hometown in a German elementary school, and he attended the other three grades and lower real high school in Gospić, where the family moved after the accident in which Tesla's brother Dane died. He was believed to be more capable and intelligent than Nikola.</p><br>
        <p>He enrolled in the High Real High School in Karlovac, and he was tormented by the fact that he was expected to continue the family tradition and become a priest. He graduated on July 24, 1873, in a group of seven students.</p><br>

  <p>Đuka Tesla
</div> 
        <p class="subhead">He went to Gospić for the holidays and fell ill with cholera. He was very ill and then he admitted to his father that he would like to study technique. His father promised him that he would go to the best technical school, after which he recovered. He spent some time in the village with his uncle, uncle Tomo Mandić, where he gathered strength for the upcoming efforts.</p><br>
        <p>In 1875 he enrolled at the Polytechnic School in Graz. He was interested in the natural sciences and spent all his free time studying. He slept four hours a day and read a large number of books, many of which he knew by heart.</p><br>
        <p>It seemed to Tesla that his father was not interested in the successes he achieved, but when he passed away, the scientist found letters sent to his father by professors advising him to drop Nikola out of school if he did not want to kill himself by overwork.</p><br>
        <p>During his studies in Graz, Tesla came up with the idea of creating a turning field. However, his professor did not agree and considered this impossible. He applied twice to Matica Srpska for a scholarship, but both times he was rejected. So he left Graz and cut off contact with relatives and friends.</p><br>

</div>
        <p class="subhead">In 1878 he started working as an assistant engineer in Maribor. He indulged in gambling, and his father barely found him and brought him home. He could not find an explanation for his son's behavior, so he passed away the following year. Tesla worked briefly at the Gospić Real Gymnasium and enrolled at a university in Prague to fulfill his father's wish. However, he was aware of the sacrifice his family was making, which is why he left his studies.</p><br>
        <p>In 1881 he moved to Budapest and was chief telephone technician at the American Telephone Company. He invented a device that some consider to be a telephone amplifier and some to be the first speaker.</p><br>
        <p>In 1882 he was employed in Paris by the Edison Continental Society. He worked as an engineer in the field of electrical equipment improvement. Having been noticed, he was recommended to Edison, who was then considered the hero of electricity. He then invented the rotating magnetic field and the inductive motor which he later constructed. He came to Gospić a few hours before his mother's death. Since he was attached to her, it hit him hard, so he recovered for three weeks in the village of Tomingaj, her birthplace.</p><br>
        <p>In 1884, Edison hired Tesla in his laboratory in New York. He soon progressed and was offered to redesign Edison's DC generator.</p><br>

        <p class="subhead">Since the patents brought him a huge profit, Edison promised Tesla $ 50,000 when he finished everything successfully. When the scientist reminded him of that, he said that he was just joking and agreed to increase his salary by 10 dollars a week. Tesla immediately resigned and terminated the cooperation.</p><br>
        <p>Edison made money by charging expensively for his direct current generators and scared people that alternating current was dangerous. Tesla refuted this by plugging in an AC circuit.</p><br>
        <p>In 1886, he founded the company "Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing". Investors did not agree to use the AC motor, which is why they denied him financial assistance.</p><br>
        <p>In 1887, he worked as an ordinary worker to feed himself and raise money to construct the first brushless AC electric motor. The Westinghouse company wanted to buy his patents in this area. He developed the principles of Tesla's (his) coil and with Westinghouse engineers he practically applied his inventions.</p><br>
        <p>He also investigated X-rays using a vacuum tube with one elbow. He believed that damage to the skin does not occur due to X-rays, but due to ozone that is formed in contact with the skin. He never published his work on this topic, and part of it was destroyed in a fire that occurred in 1895.</p><br>
        <p>In 1891, he became an American citizen. He had a new lab on Houston Street and showed a fluorescent light bulb that glows without wires.</p><br>

        <p class="subhead">In 1893, he began researching high-frequency alternating currents. It produced an alternating current of one million volts with the help of Tesla's coil. In St. Louis, he showed a broadcast similar to radio communication.</p><br>
        <p>He had to fight with proponents of the use of direct current who opposed the use of alternating current. Tesla and his like-minded people won because the World Columbus Exhibition, which was held in Chicago, was illuminated by alternating current. The scientist explained the principle of a rotating magnetic field and an induction motor.</p><br>
        <p>In 1895, he was awarded the Order of Independence of Montenegro.</p><br>
        <p>In 1897, he showed the American army a model of a radio-controlled ship. He talked about robotics and continued to research in the field of wireless signal and energy transmission. He was a key man in the construction of the first hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls, and on that occasion he spoke publicly about his research. However, they are a mystery because there was no use of wireless power transmission. Tesla wanted to use the upper layers of the globe to transfer energy from one end of the world to the other.</p><br>
        <p>In 1898, a scientist invented an electric lighter or spark plug for gasoline engines with internal combustion.</p><br>

        <p class="subhead">In 1899 he moved to Colorado Springs where he continued his research. His experiments became the subject of urban legends. In his laboratory, he proved that the Earth is a conductor and artificially caused lightning. He studied atmospheric electricity and claimed to have recorded radio signals of extraterrestrial origin. Although the scientific community rejected this data, Tesla tried for a long time to send a signal to Mars.</p><br>
        <p>He left Colorado Springs in 1900, and his lab was demolished because he was in debt. He has prepared for the next project: the construction of a wireless power transmission plant.</p><br>
        <p>One of America's richest men, JP Morgan, has invested 51% in Tesla's project called "World Radio System - Wardencliff Towers".</p><br>

</div>
        <p>In 1904, the American Patent Office granted a radio patent to Guillermo Marconi. Then Tesla started fighting to get that patent back.</p><br>
        <p>The scientist worked on the "World Radio System" project until 1905, but he gave up because he had exhausted his finances. This was a very difficult period for him and he mainly dealt with patenting new and perfecting old inventions.</p><br>
        <p>In 1906, he publicly introduced his 200-horsepower bladeless turbines at 16,000 rpm.</p><br>
       
        <p>In 1909, Marconi received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of radio. Six years later, Tesla sued him and sought judicial protection for his rights to the radio. Due to the war, he stopped receiving funds from his European patents. In 1916, he went bankrupt because he had too many expenses.</p><br>
        <p>In 1917, he built the Telefunken wireless station on Long Island, but the US Navy demolished it because German spies could have abused it. He became obsessed with number three and was irrationally afraid of germs. Little was known about the disorder at the time, so many thought it was insanity.</p><br>

        <p class="subhead">Tesla lived in the apartment of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he made a debt of 20,000 dollars. The owner of the hotel took ownership of Wardenclyffe and demolished the tower so that he could sell the plots.</p><br>
        <p>In the same year, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal and set the principles regarding the frequency and power level of the first primitive radar.</p><br>
        <p>In 1919, he published his autobiography in the form of articles in the journal "Electrical Experimenter".</p><br>
        <p>In 1926, he was awarded the Order of Saint Sava I class, Kingdom of SHS.</p><br>

        <p>In 1934, he thanked Mikhail Pupin because he believed that American companies must create a fund to ensure his carefree old age. Tesla refused, and accepted only a modest pension from the Yugoslav government. He continued to do research in accordance with his abilities and often fed pigeons.</p><br>
        <p>In 1936, he was awarded the Order of the White Eagle Class I of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.</p><br>
        <p>In 1937, he stated that he had completed a unique field theory, but no one took it seriously. He received a medal from the University of Paris and the Order of the White Lion I class, Czechoslovakia. At that time, his friends Robert Underwood Johnson and Richmond Pearson Hobson passed away, which hit him hard. In the same year, he was run over by a taxi, which further endangered his fragile health.</p><br>
        <p>In 1939, he was awarded the medal of the University of St. Clement in Sofia.</p><br>
        <p>Tesla withdrew from public life, and he was only visited by his nephew Sava Kosanović and a couple of friends. He made an exception in 1942 when King Peter II Karadjordjevic came to his apartment to meet him.</p><br>
        <p>On January 5, 1943, he called the US Department of War and offered to reveal the secret of his super weapon. The officer he was talking to thought he was crazy, so he didn't take him seriously. Two days later, Tesla died at the New Yorker Hotel. It was noted that the cause of death was cardiac thrombosis, and the time was 22 hours and 30 minutes.</p><br>
        <p>On January 12, in the church of St. John the Theologian gathered two thousand people in Manhattan and sent him to eternal rest. Violinist Zlatko Balokovic, a scientist's friend, played at the funeral. He first performed the composition "Ave Maria", and then "Far Away".</p><br>

        <p class="subhead">In 1943, the US Supreme Court returned Tesla's right to invent radio. The FBI confiscated all his property and documents from the Immigration Service and declared it a top secret.</p><br>
        <p>The scientist's family fought for that property, and his nephew Sava managed to regain a small part that is in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Since 1957, the remains of this great man have also been in the museum, in an urn that has a spherical shape.</p><br>
        <p>His name was introduced to the House of Famous Inventors of America and eight countries celebrate his birthday as a national holiday.</p><br>
